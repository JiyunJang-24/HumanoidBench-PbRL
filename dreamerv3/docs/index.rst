Embodied Docs
=============

Fast reinforcement learning research.

Overview
--------

The goal of Embodied is to empower researchers to quickly implement new agents
at scale. Embodied achieves this by specifying an interface both for
environments and agents, allowing users to mix and match agents, envs, and
evaluation protocols. Embodied provides common building blocks that users are
encouraged to fork when more control is needed. The only dependency is Numpy
and agents can be implemented in any framework.
